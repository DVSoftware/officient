# Officient Nmbrs Integration
This code is written as a NodeJS assessment task for a job application. It's not meant for production use.

## Installation
This application uses `yarn` as a package manager. If `yarn` is not installed on the system, run:
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

To install all required dependencies, run:

```bash
yarn
```

## Configuration
This application reads the configuration parameter from the environment variables, thus the following must be exported prior to starting the application:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AWS accessKey
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=AWS accessKeySecret
AWS_SQS_REGION=AWS region
AWS_SQS_QUEUE_URL=SQS Queue URL
```
These environment variables can also be placed in the `.env` file.

## Running
Execute the following command to run the application:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Testing
To run tests, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```
